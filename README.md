# formal-abstract-alg
Formalizing algebraic structures and theorems using Isabelle/HOL proof assistant.

## Overview 
This code was used to serve as both an aid in analyzing/understanding existing formalizations of algebraic structures, and as a basis to implement our own original formalization of basic algebraic theorems. Therefore, it combines streamlined versions of existing formalizations in Isabelle/HOL with our own original code/formalizations.

## Sections
Code that we have streamlined/simplified from other sources will be located under the "From Library" sections of the code, whereas our own original code will be located under "Our Additions."
