# formal-abstract-alg
Formalizing algebraic structures and theorems using Isabelle/HOL proof assistant.

## Overview 
This code was used as to serve as both an aid in analyzing existing formalizations of algebraic structures, and as a basis to implement our own original proofs of basic algebraic theorems. Therefore, it is a combines our simplified versions of existing formalizations in Isabelle/HOL with our own original code/formalizations.

## Sections
Code that we have simplified from other sources will be located under the "From Library" sections of the code, whereas our own original code will be located under "Our Additions."
